Core Features and Reports
The app fetches data from Tally Prime masters (ledgers, stock items), vouchers (sales, purchases), and reports (balance sheets, outstandings) using XML envelopes. Processing occurs in the backend for aggregations, with frontend rendering via interactive components. Below are the primary reports/dashboards, including display elements and data sources.

UI Design and User Experience
The UI adopts a modern, Tally-inspired design: clean, professional, with a dark/light mode toggle for accessibility. Built on responsive principles (mobile-first via Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS), it ensures usability on desktops, tablets, and phones—critical for field exports.

Overall Layout
Home Screen: Default multi-tile dashboard (inspired by Tally Prime 4.0+), loading as the entry point. Horizontal/vertical toggle (Alt+V) for views: horizontal for broad overviews (e.g., sales tiles side-by-side), vertical for deep dives (stacked for drill-down). Tiles auto-refresh every 5-15 minutes or on-demand.

Navigation: Sidebar menu (collapsible) with sections: Dashboard, Reports, Analytics, Settings. Top bar for search, filters (date range, company, location), and notifications bell (for alerts).

Customization: Drag-and-drop tiles (Alt+A to add, Alt+C to configure, Alt+R to remove). Users select from 50+ tile types (e.g., "Top Stock Items" under Inventory). Save views (e.g., "Export Manager View") for quick access; share via PDF/email/WhatsApp. Expand tiles (full-screen mode) for focus, with drill-down (click to voucher level).

Color Scheme & Typography: Primary blue (#007BFF) for Tally branding; greens for positives (profits), reds for alerts (overdues). Sans-serif fonts (Roboto) for readability; icons from Font Awesome for metrics (e.g., chart icons on tiles).

Key UI Components
Tiles: Modular cards (200x150px default, resizable). Each shows KPI value (e.g., "Sales: ₹5L"), graph (bar/line/pie), and data/graph toggle. Examples:

Sales Tile: Line graph of monthly revenue; hover for breakdowns (by item/location).

Inventory Tile: Gauge for stock levels (green 70-100%, yellow 30-70%, red <30%); list low-stock items.

Alert Tile: Red badge counts; expandable feed with actions (e.g., "Reorder Now" button).

Visualizations: Chart.js for charts (interactive tooltips, zoom); D3.js for advanced (heat maps, funnels). Drill-down: Click bar segment to filter dashboard (e.g., click "Dubai Region" to refresh all tiles).

Forms & Interactions: Filter dropdowns (e.g., select godown for regional views); modals for config (e.g., add KPI: checkbox ratios like debt-equity). Mobile: Swipe for tile expansion; pinch-zoom on graphs.

Accessibility & Security: WCAG-compliant (alt text on charts, keyboard nav); login with JWT (role-based: Admin sees audits, Manager sees sales). Audit logs in a secure tab.

Onboarding: Wizard for initial setup (connect Tally server, select company, configure tiles); tooltips for new users.
